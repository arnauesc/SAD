# Graphic Chat Application with Swing - Pràctica 3
This is the third project for the SAD (Software Architecture and Design) course, developed by Arnau Escolà and Carlota Julbe, for the academic year 2022-2023.

## Project Description
The Graphic Chat Application is implemented using Swing, a Java GUI toolkit. The application provides a user-friendly graphical interface for chat communication.

## Project Components
The application consists of the following components:
- The screen is divided into three areas: the entry area, message area, and user list.
Repository
- The usernames are saved in a JList using a DefaultListModel

## Usage
Once the application is launched, users can interact with the graphical interface to send and receive chat messages. The clients can choose a username and join the chat. The main screen is divided in two sections, one with the list of users and the other with the chat area.


## !!Note:
There are some issues related to the list of usernames already taken that we haven't been able to fix yet.
